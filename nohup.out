Instructions for updating:
This class is deprecated, please use tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell, which supports all the feature this cell currently has. Please replace the existing code with tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(name='basic_lstm_cell').
WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/ec2-user/deepmind_LSTM/model.py:66: softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:

Future major versions of TensorFlow will allow gradients to flow
into the labels input on backprop by default.
