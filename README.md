# Grid cells in artificial neural networks

Training an RNN on a path integration task produces grid-like representations. Trained weights are stored in [**models/example_trained_weights.npy**](models/example_trained_weights.npy)

* [**inspect_model.ipynb**](inspect_model.ipynb):
  Train a model and visualize its hidden unit ratemaps.
  
* [**main.py**](main.py):
  or, train a model from the command line.
